* This project was developed by using Javascript and jQuery
* Notification Center is an “on-page” element that shows the last three products that the user visited.
* This project can be shown on every page of the LC Waikiki website, except the Product Pages.
* (NOTE: Even if we paste the code to the console when main or category pages, it gives an error due to the website and the campaign does not work. You can test the campaign on cart page)
* This campaign only be visible after the user visits 3 products.
* Design should be responsive for all platforms; mobile, tablet, and desktop (NOTE: the campaign is not responsive yet)
